screen-shot-cast

Runs a process to watch one directory, copy images
that appear in it, to another directory, along with
a static .html file and an constantly updated .json
file that lists those images, making for a little
live web feed of your images

See the Makefile to build, and use screen-shot-cast.py
with no arguments for help.
